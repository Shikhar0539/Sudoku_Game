1. A user-friendly Sudoku Game developed using C++ technology.
2. Sudoku Game is a 9x9 matrix puzzle where each number in every row , every column and every 3x3 sub-matrix should be unique and between 1 to 9 (1 and 9 inclusive).
3. Here, user has to simply just enter the row number, column number and the digit that they want to place in.
4. Row number, column number and digit has to be from 1 to 9 , entering any other number would let them enter the number again.
5. But entering a digit at a wrong place would consume 1 mistake of the user and at max the user would be allowed a total of 5 mistakes, any mistake after that would end the game
and the user would lose.
6. I have made a Sudoku solver as well using backtracking algorithm for the users to be able to see the solved sudoku in case they are not being able to solve the Sudoku.
7. Enjoy the game and Have fun, Good luck !
